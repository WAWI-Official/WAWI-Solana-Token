## 🚀 What Makes WAWI Different

**Built Different, Built Right**

We chose rigorous testing over rushing to market:
- V1: Community testing phase
- V2-V3: Discovered Token-2022 technical constraints
- V4: Perfect deployment with optimal configuration

Zero community members were affected during our testing phase - all issues caught before public launch.
