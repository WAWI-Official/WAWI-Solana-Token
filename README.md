![WAWI Logo](https://wawi.digital/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wawi-logo-v2-TM.jpg)

**From Innovation to Impact**

WAWI is more than a memecoin - it's a movement to transform innovation into real-world impact through blockchain and AI. Our mission is to build systems that improve lives and promote equality across four fundamental pillars: Treasury (banking reimagined), Protect (blockchain insurance), Ventures (community investment), and Health (AI-augmented healthcare).

## Token Information

- **Token Name:** WAWI
- **Symbol:** WAWI
- **Blockchain:** Solana
- **Token Standard:** Token-2022 (SPL Token-2022)
- **Total Supply:** 500,000,000,000 WAWI (500 billion)
- **Decimals:** 6
- **Contract Address:** `wawi1i4SohUJmnrgMokDtUpRPB3fcYkfM5Z1LcacuC7`

### Vanity Address Authentication
The contract address begins with "wawi1" - this vanity prefix provides instant brand authentication and anti-scam protection. This address required 683 million keypair attempts to generate, making it computationally infeasible for scammers to replicate.

**Always verify:** Real WAWI contracts start with `wawi1`

## The Eternal Impact Engine

WAWI's sustainable funding mechanism. Unlike traditional projects that depend on team token sales creating constant selling pressure, our 1% transfer fee creates perpetual funding that scales with volume.

### Distribution (1% of every transaction):

- **50%** - The 4 Pillars: Treasury, Protect, Ventures, Health
- **25%** - Marketing & Growth
- **20%** - Liquidity Pool Deepening
- **5%** - Ecosystem Development

### How It Works

Every transaction automatically:
1. Funds real-world impact projects (50% to 4 Pillars)
2. Drives marketing and awareness (25%)
3. Deepens liquidity pools for better trading (20%)
4. Maintains infrastructure and development (5%)

**Result:** Self-sustaining growth without team dumps or dilution.

## Security Architecture

- ✅ **Supply:** Fixed at 500 billion tokens forever
- ✅ **Token Standard:** Token-2022 with Transfer Fee extension

### Treasury Security

- **Structure:** 3-of-5 multisig via Squads Protocol

- **Holdings:** ~400 billion WAWI (80% of supply)
- **Purpose:** Secure storage for planned allocations (team vesting, presale, liquidity pools, partnerships)

## Hybrid Funding Model

WAWI combines multiple revenue streams for sustainable growth:

1. **Strategic Presale (10%)** - Funds initial development and launch infrastructure
2. **Eternal Impact Engine (1% fee)** - Scales with volume for ongoing operations
3. **Locked Team Allocation (15%)** - 2+ years vesting ensures long-term alignment

**Result:** No forced selling pressure. As trading volume grows, fee revenue increasingly covers operations without touching locked allocations.
