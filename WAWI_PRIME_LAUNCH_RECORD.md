## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Iterative testing approach validated configuration before public launch
- Batch minting strategy solved Token-2022 supply constraints
- Vanity address generation provided strong brand protection
- Multi-signature treasury implemented before major allocation
- Fee compensation for V1 holders demonstrated commitment to community
- Complete documentation maintained throughout process

### Strategic Decisions
- **V4 to V5 transition:** Chose on-chain metadata over waiting for manual indexation
  - Accelerated roadmap by eliminating 24-72h delay
  - Enabled faster future updates
  - Improved technical foundation
  
- **Single hot wallet approach:** Simplified operations vs separate airdrop wallet
  - More flexible for day-to-day management
  - Reduced transfer fees (no internal movements)
  - Easier accounting and tracking

- **Fee compensation:** Paid 1% transfer fees for V1 holders
  - Honored pioneers with exact ratio
  - Professional execution
  - Set positive precedent

### Technical Insights
- Token-2022 has supply/decimal constraints not well documented
- Vanity address generation is computationally expensive but valuable
- On-chain metadata significantly improves user experience
- Transfer fee creates minor rounding differences (acceptable)
- Multi-signature setup requires token account creation first
