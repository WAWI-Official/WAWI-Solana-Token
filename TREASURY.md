## What This Means

**3-of-5 Multi-Signature:**
- Requires 3 independent signatures to execute any transaction
- No single person can move funds unilaterally
- Protected against theft, loss, or unauthorized access
- Standard used by major DeFi protocols

**Treasury Allocation:**
- 80% (400 billion tokens) in multi-sig (long-term security)
- 20% (100 billion tokens) in operational wallet (flexibility)

---

## Current Signers

**Configuration:** 3-of-5 multi-signature

All signers are secured with industry-standard practices:
- Hardware wallet protection
- Geographic distribution
- Secure key management
- Regular security audits

Signer composition will evolve as the project grows and decentralizes.

## Decentralization Roadmap

WAWI is committed to progressive decentralization as the project matures and the community grows.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Current)
- Establish secure infrastructure
- Prove project viability
- Build strong community
- Demonstrate long-term commitment

### Phase 2: Team Expansion (Future)
- Add team members as signers when hired
- Begin shared governance model
- Maintain security while increasing collaboration

### Phase 3: Community Governance (When Ready)
- Add elected community representatives
- Launch formal proposal system
- Transition toward community control

### Phase 4: Full Decentralization (Long-term Vision)
- Majority community-controlled signers
- Comprehensive DAO structure
- Founder becomes equal community member

**Timeline:** Driven by project milestones and community growth, not arbitrary dates.

All changes announced publicly with community input.

## Transaction Process

**How Multi-Sig Works:**

1. **Proposal Creation:** Any signer proposes a transaction (e.g., "Transfer X tokens to Y address")
2. **Review Period:** All signers can review the proposal
3. **Approval Threshold:** Need 3 of 5 signers to approve
4. **Automatic Execution:** Once threshold met, transaction executes automatically
5. **On-Chain Record:** All proposals and approvals visible on Solana blockchain

**Timeline:**
- Urgent transactions: Minutes to hours
- Standard transactions: 24-48 hours
- Major decisions: Community discussion period first

---

## Security Measures

**Multi-Layer Protection:**
- ✅ Distributed key management (5 separate wallets)
- ✅ Hardware wallet signers (Ledger devices)
- ✅ Geographic distribution (keys in multiple locations)
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ✅ Transparent on-chain governance

**What We CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Single person cannot move funds alone
- ❌ Cannot mint new tokens (authority revoked)
- ❌ Cannot freeze accounts (authority disabled)
- ❌ Cannot change token supply (immutable)

---

## Transparency Commitment

**All treasury movements are:**
- Publicly visible on Solana blockchain
- Announced on social media before execution
- Documented with clear reasoning
- Subject to community scrutiny

## Comparison to Industry Standards

| Project | Treasury Security | WAWI Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Major DeFi Protocols | 3-of-5 to 5-of-9 multi-sig | ✅ 3-of-5 |
| Professional DAOs | Hardware wallet signers | ✅ Implemented |
| Transparent Governance | On-chain proposals | ✅ Ready |
| Community Control | Gradual decentralization | ✅ Roadmap defined |

**WAWI meets or exceeds industry standards for treasury security.**

## Emergency Procedures

**In Case of Compromise:**

1. Remaining signers immediately create proposal to move funds to new multi-sig
2. Execute with 3-of-5 threshold (even if 2 keys compromised)
3. Announce incident publicly with full transparency
4. Rotate compromised keys
5. Security audit and lessons learned

**Backup Strategy:**
- 20% operational funds not in multi-sig (emergency liquidity)
- Multiple geographic key locations
- Hardware wallet cold storage
- Regular key rotation schedule
