## What This Means

**3-of-5 Multi-Signature:**
- Requires 3 independent signatures to execute any transaction
- No single person can move funds unilaterally
- Protected against theft, loss, or unauthorized access
- Standard used by major DeFi protocols

**Treasury Allocation Strategy:**
The multi-signature treasury is designed to hold the majority of WAWI tokens with a portion allocated for operational flexibility and community programs.

Specific allocation details will be announced as the project scales and the community grows.

---

## Current Signers

**Configuration:** 3-of-5 multi-signature

All signers are secured with industry-standard practices:
- Hardware wallet protection
- Geographic distribution
- Secure key management
- Regular security audits

Signer composition will evolve as the project grows.

## Transaction Process

**How Multi-Sig Works:**

1. **Proposal Creation:** Any signer proposes a transaction (e.g., "Transfer X tokens to Y address")
2. **Review Period:** All signers can review the proposal
3. **Approval Threshold:** Need 3 of 5 signers to approve
4. **Automatic Execution:** Once threshold met, transaction executes automatically
5. **On-Chain Record:** All proposals and approvals visible on Solana blockchain

**Timeline:**
- Urgent transactions: Minutes to hours
- Standard transactions: 24-48 hours
- Major decisions: Community discussion period first

---

## 1% Transfer Fee Management

WAWI Prime implements a 1% transfer fee to fund sustainable development. Fee distribution is managed transparently:

**Fee Distribution:**
- 50% Social Impact Projects (4 pillars)
- 25% Marketing & Growth (community, partnerships, listings)
- 20% Liquidity Pool Deepening (price stability)
- 5% Ecosystem Development (infrastructure, audits)

All fee destinations are transparently managed with full public visibility and verification. Every allocation decision is visible and verifiable on-chain.

---

## Security Measures

**Multi-Layer Protection:**
- Distributed key management (5 separate wallets)
- Hardware wallet signers (Ledger devices)
- Geographic distribution (keys in multiple locations)
- Regular security audits
- Transparent on-chain management

**What We CANNOT Do:**
- Single person cannot move funds alone
- Cannot mint new tokens (authority revoked)
- Cannot freeze accounts (authority disabled)
- Cannot change token supply (immutable)

---

## Transparency Commitment

**All treasury movements are:**
- Publicly visible on Solana blockchain
- Announced on social media before execution
- Documented with clear reasoning
- Subject to community scrutiny
