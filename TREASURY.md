# WAWI Treasury Architecture

## The Eternal Impact Engine

### Mechanism
WAWI implements a 1% transfer fee on all token transactions. This sustainable funding mechanism ensures continuous project development without requiring team token sales or creating selling pressure.

### Fee Distribution

Every transaction automatically distributes the 1% fee:

- **50% (0.5%)** → The 4 Pillars
  - Treasury (Banking reimagined)
  - Protect (Blockchain insurance)
  - Ventures (Community investment)
  - Health (AI-augmented healthcare)

- **25% (0.25%)** → Marketing & Growth
  - Community expansion
  - Brand awareness
  - Strategic partnerships
  - Exchange listings

- **20% (0.2%)** → Liquidity Pool Deepening
  - Reduced slippage
  - Better trading experience
  - Institutional accessibility
  - Market stability

- **5% (0.05%)** → Ecosystem Development
  - Technical infrastructure
  - Developer tools
  - Integration support
  - Platform maintenance

### Collection Mechanism
- Fees accumulate in a designated fee collection account
- Periodically transferred to treasury multisig
- Distributed according to the allocation percentages above
- All movements tracked on-chain

### Value Creation Cycle

```
Higher Volume → More Fees Collected
                     ↓
         Better Marketing & Liquidity
                     ↓
         More Holders & Deeper Pools
                     ↓
              Higher Volume
```

This self-reinforcing mechanism creates sustainable growth without dilution or selling pressure.
