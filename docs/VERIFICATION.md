This guide helps you identify the legitimate WAWI token and avoid scams.

---

## ✅ Official Token Address

The authentic WAWI V4 token address is:
```
wawi1dR9Cu6rrWJZfixcN4PcAqs2a2hH3ggKnVu7z6D
```

**Key Identifier:** The address starts with `wawi1`

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before buying WAWI, verify ALL of these:

### 1. Address Prefix
✅ **Must start with:** `wawi1`
❌ **Reject if starts with:** Anything else

**Why it matters:** We invested significant computational resources to generate this premium vanity address. Scammers cannot afford to replicate it.

---

### 2. Total Supply
✅ **Correct supply:** Exactly 500,000,000,000 tokens
❌ **Wrong if:** Any other number

**How to check:**
1. Go to [Solscan](https://solscan.io/token/wawi1dR9Cu6rrWJZfixcN4PcAqs2a2hH3ggKnVu7z6D)
2. Look at "Current Supply"
3. Verify it shows 500,000,000,000

---

### 3. Mint Authority
✅ **Must be:** null (not set)
❌ **Red flag if:** Shows an address

**Why it matters:** Null mint authority means supply is permanently fixed - no one can create more tokens.

**How to check:**
1. On Solscan, click "View details" under Authority
2. Verify "Mint Authority" shows "N/A"

---

### 4. Freeze Authority
✅ **Must be:** null (not set)
❌ **Red flag if:** Shows an address

**Why it matters:** Null freeze authority means tokens cannot be frozen - true decentralization.

**How to check:**
1. On Solscan, click "View details" under Authority
2. Verify "Freeze Authority" shows "N/A"

---

### 5. Decimals
✅ **Correct:** 6 decimals
❌ **Wrong if:** Any other number

**How to check:**
1. On Solscan, look at "Decimals" field
2. Verify it shows 6

---

### 6. Token Program
✅ **Correct:** Token-2022 Program
❌ **Wrong if:** Different program

**How to check:**
1. On Solscan, look at "Owner Program"
2. Verify it shows "Token 2022 Program"

## 🚨 Common Scam Tactics

Scammers try to trick you with:

### Similar-Looking Addresses
❌ `waw1...` (lowercase w + number 1)
❌ `wawii...` (double i)
❌ `WAWI1...` (all caps - impossible in Base58)
❌ `wawi0...` (zero instead of one)

✅ **Only trust:** `wawi1...` (lowercase wawi + number 1)

---

### Wrong Supply
❌ 1,000,000,000 (1 billion)
❌ 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion)
❌ Any number except 500,000,000,000

✅ **Only trust:** Exactly 500,000,000,000

---

### Active Authorities
❌ Mint authority showing an address
❌ Freeze authority showing an address

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Active mint = owner can create unlimited tokens (dilution)
- Active freeze = owner can lock your tokens

✅ **Only trust:** Both authorities showing "N/A" or "null"

---

## 📱 Quick Verification Steps

**On mobile or in a hurry? Use this 3-step check:**

1. **Check the address starts with `wawi1`** ✅
2. **Verify supply is 500,000,000,000** ✅
3. **Confirm both authorities are null** ✅

If ANY of these fail, it's a scam. Walk away.
